# rrt-fagkveld

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to two (hopefully) new things.

1. The Rust programming language
2. Ray tracing

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on high performance and memory safety.
By leveraging zero-cost abstractions and a strict compiler, the languages goes a long way of providing and ensuring these two things.

A ray tracer is a program that renders a scene by approximating actual light rays and their path through the physical world.
We will start to implement a very simple ray tracer, and by the end of the workshop you should be able to get some nice looking images.

Why are we learning Rust by writing a ray tracer?
